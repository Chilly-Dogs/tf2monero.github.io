My name is Elijah, or you can call me Chilly.
I'm 19 and I'm from South Carolina, USA.

I recently made a TF2 website, https://www.chillydogs.xyz

Because of how risky cashing out can be, I made a website for making safe transactions between TF2 & Monero, as I believe this solves a big issue in the community.

So as the title suggests, I would like you to promote my website in your next TF2 related video.
All I want you to say is, 
"By the way guys, this video is sponsored by chillydogs.xyz, it's a middleman service for making safe transactions between TF2 and Monero. The link is in the description."

Then link the website in the description and pinned comment.
Use this image provided in the email when you saying the script, but also feel free to improvise a little.

PAYMENT:
As for the payment amount, I was thinking of around $325
But this amount can be negotiated of course.


My Youtube Video on my Website:


Let me know what you think of my offer.
